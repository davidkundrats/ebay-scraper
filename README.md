# ebay-scraper
a simple gui based ebay scraper to demonstrate basic webscraping and its applications

(2/17/23)

As it stands, unless otherwise stated in the future, this program will only work on scraping SOLD listings from ebay. 
Current listings are not accounted for and will not parse; this is not the aim of the program. 
New commits added daily as this is a WORK IN PROGRESS. Run at your own risk. 
Running is simple; pull from the repo, install the requirements, and run from the configuration of your choosing.
