# ebay-scraper
a simple ebay scraper to demonstrate basic webscraping and its applications

(2/17/23)

As it stands, unless otherwise stated in the future, this program will only work on scraping SOLD listings from ebay. 
Current listings are not accounted for and will not parse; this is not the aim of the program. 
New commits added when I have the time: this is a WORK IN PROGRESS 
Running is simple; clone from the repo, activate venv and you'll be set.
