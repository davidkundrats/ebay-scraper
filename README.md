# ebay-scraper
a simple ebay scraper to demonstrate basic webscraping and its applications

(8/30/23)

As it stands, unless otherwise stated in the future, this program will only work on scraping SOLD listings from ebay. 
Current listings are not accounted for and will not parse; this is not the aim of the program. 
New commits added when I have the time: this is a WORK IN PROGRESS 
Running is simple; clone the repo, create/activate venv and install -r requirements and you'll be set.

*If using Arch, you may encounter the error "Python not configured for Tk"* 
to solve this, install TK globally on your system: 
<pre>
sudo pacman -S tk
</pre>
